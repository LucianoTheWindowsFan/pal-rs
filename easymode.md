"Easy mode" mappings

- Random seed: keep
- Bandwidth scale: lock at 1.0
- Use field: keep?
- Lowpass filter type: "Softer" and "Sharper" (scale other sharpening factors to look good automatically)
- Input luma filter: lock at ???
- Chroma low-pass in: lock at ??? (maybe roll up with input luma into "Crosstalk Artifacts" checkbox?)
- Composite preemphasis: keep as "Saturation"
- Composite noise: keep? Or just replace with luma/chroma noise
- Snow: keep
- Snow anisotropy: lock at ???
- Scanline phase shift: lock at 180
- Scanline phase shift offset: lock at 0
- Chroma demodulation filter: keep but simplify somehow?
- Luma smear: keep
- Head switching: keep as group?
  - Height: keep
  - Offset: lock to portion of height
  - Horizontal shift: lock?
  - Start mid-line: lock enabled
- Tracking noise: keep as group
  - Height: keep
  - Wave intensity: group as "intensity"
  - Snow intensity: group as "intensity"
  - Snow anisotropy: lock at ???
  - Noise intensity: group as "intensity"
- Ringing: keep "Scale", lock others
- Luma noise: keep
- Chroma noise: keep
- Chroma phase error: lock at 0
- Chroma phase noise: keep?
- Chroma delay (horizontal): figure out automagically
- Chroma delay (vertical): lock at 0
- VHS emulation
  - Tape speed: keep
  - Chroma loss: keep
  - Sharpen: keep as 1 slider, scaled to lowpass filter type
  - Edge wave
    - Intensity: keep
    - Speed: lock at ???
    - Frequency: keep
    - Detail: lock at ???
